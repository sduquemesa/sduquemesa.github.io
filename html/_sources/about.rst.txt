I am  interested in topics that move across the thresholds
of quantum theory, machine systems, and embodied experience. 
Trained in the physics
of light-matter entanglement and quantum computation, 
I currently work as a Quantum Architect on the scalable development of photonic quantum
architectures. 
This technical focus is part of a broader inquiry into how emerging quantum
technologies intersect with cognition and perception—my side ongoing research
explores how quantum technologies and cybernetic thought co-compose new modes of
sensing, relating, and becoming.

My broader practice emerges from this same terrain, where code becomes perceptual,
and computation leaks into affect. Through writing, sound synthesis and custom electronic
systems, I think and build generative environments that reconfigure nature as a machinic
intelligence—distributed, recursive, and alive. Installations and audiovisual works blur
disciplinary boundaries, tracing speculative ecologies where the organic and the
synthetic, the theoretical and the felt, entangle and evolve.
