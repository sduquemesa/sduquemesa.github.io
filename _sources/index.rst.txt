My interests span across quantum physics, computation, and generative art. Trained in light-matter
entanglement and quantum architectures, I develop scalable photonic quantum
technologies while thinking on the epistemic and perceptual implications
of emerging computation. My broder practice extends this inquiry through sound and 
custom electronic systems that create generative environments where the
synthetic and the organic blur into new modes of sensing and relation.
