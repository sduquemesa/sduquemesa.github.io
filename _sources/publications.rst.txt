*A modular photonic quantum computer*
=====================================

* Aghaee Rad, H. *et al.* Scaling and networking a modular photonic quantum computer. `Nature 638, 912-919 (2025) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08406-9>`__.

*Aurora*, the first modular, networked photonic quantum computer (Xanadu, 2025). 
Four interconnected racks, 35 photonic chips, 13 km fiber interconnects,
operating at room temperature. Demonstrated scalability, interconnect architecture,
and full subsystem integration—a blueprint for quantum data centers and next-generation
photonic quantum hardware.

As part of the project, I contributed to the development of the theoretical framework
that underpins the architecture, working alongside the team to formalize how modular
photonic nodes can be unified into a proof-of-concept quantum logical system. 
I also helped build and refine the software tools used for large-scale architectural
simulation, enabling the exploration of design choices, error models, and system-level
behaviors essential to Aurora's scalability.

*Searching for new fundamental particles using atoms*
======================================================

* Duque, S (2019). `Search for New Physics with Rydberg Atoms`_. Weizmann Institute of Science. 

In this research project I explored how highly excited Rydberg states can serve as precision probes
for physics beyond the Standard Model. Unlike low-lying atomic states—where isotope shifts are
dominated by complex, hard-to-calculate nuclear structure—Rydberg states are far less sensitive
to nuclear and electronic systematics due to the large orbital radius and minimal nuclear overlap
of the valence electron. Building on this property, I developed a strategy to construct observables
that isolate potential new light, mass-dependent force mediators between electrons and neutrons,
while remaining independent of nuclear effects at leading order. The work demonstrates how Rydberg
atoms provide a clean, theoretically tractable platform for searching for new fundamental interactions.

*Do plants need quanta?*
========================

* Duque, Sebastián *et al.* Classical Approach to Multichromophoric Resonance Energy Transfer. `Physical Review Letters 115, 110402 (2015) <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.110402>`__.

This work develops a classical electrodynamics description of how energy moves between groups of molecules
that both donate and accept energy—patterns common in natural light-harvesting systems. The theory breaks
down the different physical processes that contribute to energy transfer and explains why having many donors
and acceptors can dramatically increase the overall transfer rate. When applied to real biological systems
like the LHII complex, it matches experimental measurements remarkably well. The key result is that, 
whenever the system behaves linearly, this classical approach gives the same predictions as the full
quantum theory, providing a simple and intuitive way to understand a phenomenon usually treated quantum
mechanically.
